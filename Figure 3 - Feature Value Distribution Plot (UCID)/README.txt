Instructions to run the code:

The code is designed for Google Colab Environment. So one may need to make few changes to run it on a local machine.

You can use either option to run the code in colab...

OPTION 1: Runing Full Code
	> You need to run all cells as in the notebook
	> You have to connect the Google Drive
	> The "ucid_v2.zip" file or its shortcut should be present in the root directory of the Drive. (Make sure the name of zip file exactly match as mentioned)
	> It will take around 6 - 7H to run all cells and generate Distribution Graph.


OPTION 2: Only generate graph.
	> To skip the time consuming part, we have provided all the nesesary files to generate the plot whithout calculating all values again.
	> First connect the Drive.
	> Put the folder "MF_Detection_Results" and all its files at root directory of Drive.
	> Run the cell containing import commands like "import time, os, math" (2nd code cell)
	> Run the last cell i.e. the only cell under the heading "Building Scatter-plot".
