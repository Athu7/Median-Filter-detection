Instructions to run the code:

The code is designed for Google Colab Environment. So one may need to make few changes to run it on a local machine.

You can use either option to run the code in colab...

OPTION 1: Runing Full Code
	> You first need to run the code under "Figure 3 - Feature Value Distribution Plot (UCID)" (or atleast for 1. Original Images, 2. 3x3 Median Filtered, 3. 5x5 Median Filtered, 4. 7x7 Median Filtered, 5. 9x9 Median Filtered).
	> You have to connect the Google Drive. At this point, the "Figure 3 - Feature Value Distribution Plot (UCID)" code should have produced the one fulder "MF_Detection_Results" in the root directory.
	> Run the full code


OPTION 2: Only generate graph.
	> To skip the time consuming part, we have provided all the nesesary files to generate the plot whithout running the "Figure 3 - Feature Value Distribution Plot (UCID)" file.
	> First connect the Drive.
	> Put the folder "MF_Detection_Results" and all its files at root directory of Drive.
	> Run the whole code.
